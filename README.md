import { Plugin } from 'vue-responsive-video-background-player'

Vue.use(Plugin)
```

### (3: Only for Nuxt.js users)
#### Nuxt.js v3
 >Thanks to [@Vertenz](https://github.com/avidofood/vue-responsive-video-background-player/issues/8#issuecomment-1192011721) for his instructions:

 for NUXT v3 I used directive to make it work. Create **plugins** directory then add **video-bg.client.ts** _(or any name but **.client** is obligatory for client side render, cause you don't have the window at ssr)_ file with

```
import { defineNuxtPlugin } from "#app";
import { Plugin } from "vue-responsive-video-background-player";

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Plugin);
});
```

then you use the **video-background** tag

## Usage - (or to make it runnable üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

### Easiest version üîç

```html
 <video-background
    src="<your-video-path>.mp4"
    style="max-height: 400px; height: 100vh;"
 >
    <h1 style="color: white;">Hello welcome!</h1>
 </video-background>
```

### Advanced version üåê

```html
 <video-background
    src="<your-default-video-path>.mp4"
    poster="/images/mainfoto.jpg"
    :sources="[
        {src: '<your-tablet-video-path>.mp4', res: 900, autoplay: true},
        {src: '<your-mobile-video-path>.mp4', res: 638, autoplay: true, poster: '<your-mobile-background-image-path>.png'}
    ]"
    style="max-height: 400px; height: 100vh;"
    overlay="linear-gradient(45deg,#2a4ae430,#fb949e6b)"
>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Hallo welcome!</h1>
</video-background>
```

### Demo ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Props

This package is for responsive videos depicting different video resolution. Have you ever visited my favorite car company <a href="https://tesla.com">Tesla</a>? Have a look, they use a lot of video background videos and are using different resolutions for each device.

### Props values

#### `src`

**Required.**

This is your path to your video. You can just use this value for showing your video in every resolution.

 >**Warning** for [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html): You need to bind the source like this: ``:src="require(`@/assets/video/timelapse.mp4`)"``. [Read here why](https://github.com/avidofood/vue-responsive-video-background-player/issues/10#issuecomment-646959090)

#### `poster` 

default: `''`

This is your first background image that is shown before the video is loaded.

 >**Warning** for [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html): You need to bind the source like this: ``:src="require(`@/assets/img/logo.png`)"``. [Read here why](https://github.com/avidofood/vue-responsive-video-background-player/issues/10#issuecomment-646959090)

#### `sources` 

(default: `[]`)

This is the main reason for this package. I wanted to have the possibility to change the resolution of the video when the resize event is fired.

To make it work, sources is an array that contains objects. For example:

````ts
[{
	src: '<your-mobile-video-path>.mp4',
	res: 638,
	autoplay: true,
	poster: '<your-mobile-background-image-path>.png'
}]
````

To make it work you need at least `src`, `res`, `autoplay`.

`poster` is optional.

`res` stand for resolution. This example means that between 0px and 638px of the window's width only the mobile video will be shown. After that your default `src`.

#### `autoplay` 

(default: `true`)

The video is going to be played immediately when the video is ready. If you are setting it to false, you can start the video just by `this.$refs.videobackground.player.play()`. But remember to set `ref=videobackground` to the HTML tag `<video-background>`, so that it can work.

#### `overlay` 

(default: `''`)

If you love overlays, then copy the overlay from the advanced example.

#### `muted`

 (default: `true`)

Warning. Videos are perhaps not played when unmuted.

#### `loop` 

(default: `true`)

Loops through the video. You can catch the event `ended` to show only the poster.

#### `preload` 

(default: `auto`)

Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#preload

#### `objectFit` 

(default: `cover`)

So the video fits perfectly in the container

Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit

#### `playsWhen` 

(default: `canplay`)

This is important, if you know that you might have users with bad internet speed, you should definetly use `canplaythrough`. Learn more in [video events](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp).

#### `playbackRate` 

(default: `1.0`)

The playbackRate property sets the current playback speed of the video. [Example](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_video_playbackrate.asp) but negative values didn't work for me?

#### `transition`

'(default: `fade`)

You can add your own transition styles here. If you set it to empty string, it won't show any transitions.

## Events

- `ready`: Video is loaded
- `playing`: Video is playing
- `error`: Video error
- `loading`: Video is loading
- `ended`: Video finished, only when `loop` is set to false

## Methods

If you happen to need more control over the player, you can use the internal methods. For that, you need to set `ref=videobackground` to the HTML tag `<video-background>`. After that you can call all methods like this `this.$refs.videobackground.player.play()`.

- `play()`: Video is playing
- `pause()`: Video is paused
- `show()`: Video is shown
- `hide()`: Video is hidden, the poster is shown
- `load()`: Video is loaded
